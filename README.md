# OctoC2t
Simple C2 using GitHub repository as comms channel. This is just a PoC to show how it is possible to use pretty much any channel you can think of to send & receive commands.

I decided not to release agent code for a few reasons. First, it's great practice to make your own agent. Second, I'm still actively using my agent and don't want it to get signatured too soon :) - However, there are clear instructions on how to code your own below with whatever language you like.

## Installation
- Download & install dependencies
```sh
git clone https://github.com/deletehead/OctoC2t
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
- Run it!
```sh
python3 octoc2t.py
```

## Agents

## Usage
- Set up `constants.py` with your username, repo name, and PAT
-
